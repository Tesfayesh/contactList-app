I use MERN stack to create a CRUD application. I creates a simple Contact List app where a user can create a phone number along with the name,
update the phone number, see the phone number list and finally, delete it.

In this stack stack, I use MongoDB to store data, expressJS to handle the backend, and ReactJS to handle the frontend.
